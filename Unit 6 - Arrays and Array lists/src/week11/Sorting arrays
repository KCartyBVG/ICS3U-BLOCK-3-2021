for loop inside a for loop - quadratic

selectionsort algorithm: NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR WRITING, RESPONSIBLE FOR RECONGNIZING
    - has sorted and unsorted side
    - uses a for loop, looks for the smallest element
    - swaps it with the front of the unsorted side/end of sorted side (included in sorted side)

    - uses a for loop to go throught the whole sequence
- even if its sorted, it still goes through the sorted section - not any faster


interionsort algorithm:
    - grabs the first element from the unsorted side, inserts to the front of the sorted side + shifts other elements
    - IF THE ARRAY IS ALMOST SORTED, it just moves it over to the sorted side
